# CLIR_IMU
A c++ class to use the BNO055 IMU

The purpose of this software is to provide a class to use teh BNO0555 9DOF sensor on the [Beagle Bone Black](https://beagleboard.org/black).

The software is roughly based on the [Unified sensor driver for the Adafruit BNO055 orientation sensor breakout ](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BNO055/).
