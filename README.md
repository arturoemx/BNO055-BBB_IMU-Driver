# BNO055-BBB_IMU Driver
A c++ class to use the BNO055 IMU

The purpose of this software is to provide a class to use the BNO0555 9DOF sensor on the [Beagle Bone Black](https://beagleboard.org/black).

The software is roughly based on the [Unified sensor driver for the Adafruit BNO055 orientation sensor breakout ](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BNO055/).

This software is being developed as part of research work being done at the Computational Learning and Imaging Research Laboratory [CLIR-Lab](https://www.clir-lab.org/), and is also used for teaching at the Faculty of Mathematics of the authonomous University of Yucatan.
